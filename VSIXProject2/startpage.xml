  <features>
    <feature name="IntelliSense">
		By pressing CTRL+Space, IntelliSense will provide an array of options that make language references easily accessible. 
		When coding, you do not need to leave the editor window to perform searches on database elements. 
		You can keep your context, find the information you need, insert elements directly, and even have IntelliSense complete your typing.
		IntelliSense comprises database objects, reserved words, local variables  and columns. 
		Tip: Use wild-card such as "sp*time" to get all stored procedures which ends with "time". 
		</feature>
    <feature name="Workspace">
		Workspaces are used for organizing script files. Workspace items are similar to shortcuts where each "file" can be included in several workspaces. 
		</feature>
    <feature name="Export to Excel">
		This feature is implemented as a Plug-in. Enabling this option will save the grid output as an Microsoft Excel file.
		</feature>
    <feature name="Source Control">
		Integration with Visual SourceSafe enables developers to access team development features such as check-in and check-out, 
		history etc. QueryCommander does NOT provide support for all features in Visual SourceSafe. 
		To consume all features of Visual SourceSafe, the developer environment need access local recourses (files). 
		Since working with database objects (tables, views, stored procedures and functions), developers might collaborate with others, sharing the same objects. 
		Itâ€™s there for important to understand that altering a checked-out object will make changes visible to others as if there where no source control. It will however prevent other users (using QueryCommander) from altering the same object.

		</feature>
    <feature name="Go to Definition/Go to Reference">
		Perhaps the most appreciated feature of all. Pointing the cursor to a database object (in the query window) and pressing F12 will open a new window with the definition of the choosen object. 
		Pressing Shift+F12 will present a dialog with all objects using the choosen object.
		</feature>
    <feature name="Xml2Data">
		Create table structure from xml file, and populate the tables with data from the same file. To preserve the structure of the document, QueryCommander can add identifiers and foreign keys to the tables.
		</feature>
    <feature name="Comment header help">
		You can document stored procedures using XML. 
		By pressing F11 or by using the Tool menu you can add comment header above the declaration of the procedure, 
		function or view. You can (should) complement the header tags with additional information. 
		First time you add a header, a &lt;revision&gt; tag with the value "Created" will be added. 
		When you later alter the same object, an additional &lt;revision&gt; tag with the value "Altered" will be added.
		</feature>
    <feature name="Documentation">
		QueryCommander will process documentation comment headers in the choosen database to an XML file. The xml file is then parsed thought an xsl file to 
		deliver you a documentation of all database objects (not tables since they are not allowed to be commented).
		</feature>
    <feature name="Script for insert and update">
		By querying a table for a selected content you can create insert and update scripts through the Tool menu.
		</feature>
    <feature name="Edit in grid">
		When querying a single table (no joins),  you can manipulate the result in the output window. 
		</feature>
    <feature name="Updates">
		You will be notified about new updates and releases upon starting QueryCommander. You can then choose to update by pressing the Update now button. 
		</feature>
    <feature name="Query statistics message">
		Enabling this option will inform the user about ineffective query plans.
		</feature>
    <feature name="Parenthesis recognition">
		The query window will highlight the scope of the parenthesis.
		</feature>
    <feature name="Run current query">
		Simply point to the query you want to execute and press F9. No need to select the query to be executed.
		</feature>
